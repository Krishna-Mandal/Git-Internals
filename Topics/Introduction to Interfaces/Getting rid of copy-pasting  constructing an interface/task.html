<h2>Getting rid of copy-pasting: constructing an interface</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Suppose you're working with a set of classes as follows:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Triangle {
    val angles = 3
    val scale = 1.0

    fun draw() {
        /* ... */
    }
}

class Rectangle {
    val angles = 4
    val scale = 1.0

    fun draw() {
        /* ... */
    }
}

class Hexagon {
    val angles = 6
    val scale = 1.0

    fun draw() {
        /* ... */
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>As you can see, these classes have a few things in common, so it would be convenient in terms of optimizing the code if all of them were implementations of a certain interface.</p> 
  <p>Introduce an interface so that any of the above classes could be implementations of this interface. </p>
